    question: "How does the mortgage calculator work?",
    answer: "The mortgage calculator estimates your monthly principal and interest payments based on the home price, down payment, loan term, and interest rate you enter.

For more details, visit the <a href='/mortgage' class='text-primary hover:underline'>Mortgage Calculator page</a>."

    question: "What is a land loan?",
    answer: "A land loan is used to finance the purchase of a plot of land. These loans can sometimes have different terms and interest rates compared to traditional mortgages, as lending on raw land can be considered riskier by financial institutions. Check out our <a href='/land-loan' class='text-primary hover:underline'>Land Loan Calculator</a> for estimates."

  {
    question: "Can I save my calculations?",
    answer: "Currently, our calculators do not support saving results directly on the website. We recommend taking a screenshot or noting down the results for your records. We are exploring options to add saving functionality in the future. Your privacy is important; see our <a href='/privacy-policy' class='text-primary hover:underline'>Privacy Policy</a>."

  {
    question: "What is the difference between APR and interest rate?",
    answer: "The interest rate is the cost of borrowing the principal loan amount. The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) includes the interest rate plus other loan fees (like origination fees or points), giving you a more complete picture of the loan's annual cost. Our calculators primarily use the interest rate, but it's important to consider the APR when comparing loan offers from lenders."

  {
    question: "How can I improve my chances of loan approval?",
    answer: "Improving your credit score, saving for a larger down payment, reducing existing debt, and having a stable income can all improve your chances of loan approval and help you secure better terms. Our <a href='/loan' class='text-primary hover:underline'>Loan Calculator</a> can help you understand potential payments."

  {
    question: "What should I consider when refinancing?",
    answer: "When refinancing, consider the new interest rate, loan term, closing costs, and how long you plan to stay in your home. The goal is usually to save money, either monthly or over the life of the loan. Use our <a href='/refinance' class='text-primary hover:underline'>Refinance Calculator</a> to analyze potential savings."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it better to take a shorter or longer loan term?",
    answer: "A shorter loan term typically means higher monthly payments but less total interest paid. A longer term means lower monthly payments but more total interest. The best choice depends on your budget and financial goals. You can compare scenarios using our various loan calculators, like the <a href='/auto-loan' class='text-primary hover:underline'>Auto Loan Calculator</a>."
