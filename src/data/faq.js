    question: "What is a land loan?",
    answer: "A land loan is used to finance the purchase of a plot of land. These loans can sometimes have different terms and interest rates compared to traditional mortgages, as lending on raw land can be considered riskier by financial institutions."

  {
    question: "What is the difference between APR and interest rate?",
    answer: "The interest rate is the cost of borrowing the principal loan amount. The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) includes the interest rate plus other loan fees (like origination fees or points), giving you a more complete picture of the loan's annual cost. Our calculators primarily use the interest rate, but it's important to consider the APR when comparing loan offers."
