    {
      question: "How much of my income should go to car payments?",
      answer: "Financial experts typically recommend that your total car expenses (including loan payments, insurance, maintenance, and fuel) should not exceed 15-20% of your monthly take-home pay. The calculator helps you stay within this guideline while considering your other financial obligations."
    },
    {
      question: "What factors affect car affordability?",
      answer: "Key factors include your monthly income, existing expenses, down payment amount, loan term, interest rate, and additional costs like insurance, maintenance, and fuel. The calculator takes these into account to provide a comprehensive affordability estimate."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the down payment affect affordability?",
      answer: "A larger down payment reduces your loan amount, which can lower your monthly payments and potentially get you a better interest rate. The calculator shows how different down payment amounts affect your maximum car price and monthly payments."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 20/4/10 rule?",
      answer: "The 20/4/10 rule is a guideline suggesting: 20% down payment, 4-year loan term, and monthly car expenses (including loan payment, insurance, and maintenance) not exceeding 10% of your gross monthly income. The calculator helps you apply this rule to your situation."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I consider additional costs beyond the car payment?",
      answer: "Yes, you should factor in insurance, maintenance, fuel, registration, and potential repairs. The calculator includes these costs in its affordability assessment to give you a more accurate picture of total car ownership expenses."
    },
    {
      question: "How does loan term affect affordability?",
      answer: "Longer loan terms (e.g., 72 months vs. 36 months) can lower monthly payments but increase total interest costs. The calculator helps you compare different loan terms to find the right balance between monthly affordability and total cost."
    },
    {
      question: "What credit score do I need for a car loan?",
      answer: "While requirements vary by lender, generally: Excellent (720+) gets the best rates, Good (690-719) gets competitive rates, Fair (630-689) may get higher rates, and Poor (below 630) may face challenges. The calculator helps you estimate payments based on different interest rates."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I improve my car affordability?",
      answer: "You can improve affordability by: saving for a larger down payment, improving your credit score, choosing a shorter loan term, considering a less expensive car, or reducing other expenses. The calculator helps you explore these options."
