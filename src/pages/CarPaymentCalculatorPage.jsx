    {
      question: "How is a car payment calculated?",
      answer: "Car payments are calculated using the loan amount (car price minus down payment), interest rate, and loan term. The calculator uses the standard amortization formula to determine your monthly payment, including principal and interest."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a good interest rate for a car loan?",
      answer: "Interest rates vary based on credit score, loan term, and market conditions. Generally: Excellent credit (720+) can get rates under 3%, Good credit (690-719) around 3-5%, Fair credit (630-689) 5-8%, and Poor credit (below 630) may face rates above 8%. The calculator helps you estimate payments at different rates."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the down payment affect my payment?",
      answer: "A larger down payment reduces your loan amount, which can lower your monthly payment and potentially get you a better interest rate. The calculator shows how different down payment amounts affect your monthly payment and total cost."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the typical car loan term?",
      answer: "Car loan terms typically range from 36 to 72 months (3 to 6 years). While longer terms mean lower monthly payments, they also result in higher total interest costs. The calculator helps you compare different term options."
    },
    {
      question: "What additional costs should I consider?",
      answer: "Beyond the monthly payment, consider: sales tax, registration fees, insurance, maintenance, fuel, and potential repairs. The calculator helps you understand the total cost of ownership."
