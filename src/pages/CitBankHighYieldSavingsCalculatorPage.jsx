    {
      question: "What is a High Yield Savings Account?",
      answer: "A High Yield Savings Account is a type of savings account that offers a higher interest rate than traditional savings accounts. CIT Bank's High Yield Savings Account typically offers competitive rates with daily compounding interest."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the interest rate compare to regular savings accounts?",
      answer: "CIT Bank's High Yield Savings Account typically offers rates that are significantly higher than traditional savings accounts. While regular savings accounts might offer 0.01% to 0.05% APY, high yield accounts can offer rates 10-20 times higher."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any fees or minimum balance requirements?",
      answer: "CIT Bank's High Yield Savings Account typically requires a minimum opening deposit of $100. There are usually no monthly maintenance fees, but check current terms as they may change. The calculator helps you understand the impact of these requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "How often is interest compounded?",
      answer: "CIT Bank compounds interest daily on their High Yield Savings Account, which is reflected in the APY. This means you earn interest on your interest, helping your savings grow faster than with less frequent compounding."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my money safe in a High Yield Savings Account?",
      answer: "Yes, CIT Bank is FDIC insured, which means your deposits are protected up to $250,000 per depositor, per account type. This makes it as safe as a traditional savings account while offering higher returns."
