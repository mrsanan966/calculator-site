    {
      question: "What types of accounts can I calculate with the CIT Bank Calculator?",
      answer: "The calculator supports CIT Bank's High Yield Savings accounts, Money Market accounts, and Certificates of Deposit (CDs). Each account type has different interest rates and terms that affect your potential earnings."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are the interest rate calculations?",
      answer: "The calculator uses current CIT Bank rates, but these rates can change. For the most accurate results, verify current rates on CIT Bank's website before making decisions. The calculator provides estimates based on the rates you input."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between APY and APR?",
      answer: "APY (Annual Percentage Yield) includes compound interest, while APR (Annual Percentage Rate) doesn't. CIT Bank uses APY for savings products, which gives you a more accurate picture of your potential earnings."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I calculate returns for multiple accounts?",
      answer: "Yes, you can use the calculator multiple times to compare different account types, deposit amounts, and terms. This helps you find the best savings strategy for your financial goals."
    },
    {
      question: "How often does CIT Bank compound interest?",
      answer: "CIT Bank compounds interest daily on most savings products, which is reflected in the APY. This means you earn interest on your interest, helping your savings grow faster."
