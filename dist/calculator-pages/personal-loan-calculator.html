        <p>Your monthly personal loan payment is calculated using the formula:</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>What is a personal loan calculator?</h3>
          <p>A personal loan calculator helps you estimate your monthly payments, total interest, and total cost for a personal loan. It's useful for budgeting and comparing different loan options before applying.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What factors affect my personal loan interest rate?</h3>
          <p>Your credit score is the primary factor, along with your income, debt-to-income ratio, employment history, and the loan amount. Higher credit scores typically qualify for lower interest rates.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How long should my personal loan term be?</h3>
          <p>Shorter terms mean higher monthly payments but less total interest paid. Longer terms mean lower monthly payments but more total interest. Choose based on your budget and financial goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Can I pay off my personal loan early?</h3>
          <p>Most personal loans allow early payoff without penalty, but check your loan terms. Paying early can save you significant interest, especially on longer-term loans.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between secured and unsecured personal loans?</h3>
          <p>Unsecured personal loans don't require collateral but typically have higher interest rates. Secured loans use collateral (like a car) and often have lower rates but risk losing the collateral if you default.</p>
