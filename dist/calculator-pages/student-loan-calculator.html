        <h2>Student Loan Payment Formula</h2>
        <p>Your monthly student loan payment is calculated using the formula:</p>
        <p><strong>M = P × (r × (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)</strong></p>
        <p>Where: P = Loan Amount, r = Monthly Interest Rate, n = Number of Payments</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>How is my student loan payment calculated?</h3>
          <p>Your student loan payment is calculated based on the principal amount borrowed, the interest rate, and the repayment term. Federal loans often have various repayment plans that can adjust your monthly payment.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What are the different types of student loan repayment plans?</h3>
          <p>Common plans include Standard (fixed payments over 10 years), Graduated (payments start low and increase), and Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans, which adjust payments based on your income and family size.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Can I get student loan forgiveness?</h3>
          <p>Certain federal student loans may be eligible for forgiveness programs, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for those working in public service, or forgiveness after a certain period on an IDR plan. Eligibility criteria apply.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What is student loan consolidation?</h3>
          <p>Student loan consolidation combines multiple federal student loans into a single Direct Consolidation Loan. This can simplify payments and potentially lower your monthly payment by extending the repayment period, though it may increase total interest paid.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How does interest accrue on student loans?</h3>
          <p>Interest accrues daily on your outstanding principal balance. For unsubsidized loans, interest accrues even while you're in school or during deferment. For subsidized loans, the government pays the interest during certain periods.</p>
        </div>
