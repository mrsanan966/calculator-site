        <h2>Investment Growth Formula</h2>
        <p>Your investment growth is calculated using compound interest:</p>
        <p><strong>Future Value = P × (1 + r)^n + PMT × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r]</strong></p>
        <p>Where: P = Initial investment, r = Monthly return rate, n = Number of months, PMT = Monthly contribution</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>How does compound interest work in investments?</h3>
          <p>Compound interest means you earn returns not only on your initial investment but also on the returns you've already earned. This creates exponential growth over time, making it one of the most powerful wealth-building tools.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between simple and compound interest?</h3>
          <p>Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any previously earned interest. Compound interest grows your money much faster over long periods.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How much should I invest monthly?</h3>
          <p>The amount depends on your financial goals, income, and expenses. A common rule is to invest 10-20% of your income, but start with what you can afford and increase over time. Even small amounts can grow significantly with compound interest.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's a realistic expected return rate?</h3>
          <p>Historical stock market returns average around 7-10% annually, but this varies by investment type and time period. Conservative investments might return 3-5%, while aggressive growth investments might target 10-12% or higher.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How does time affect investment growth?</h3>
          <p>Time is the most powerful factor in investment growth due to compound interest. Starting early, even with smaller amounts, often results in more wealth than starting later with larger amounts due to the exponential nature of compound growth.</p>
