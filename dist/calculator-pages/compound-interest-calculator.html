        <p><strong>A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)</strong></p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>What is compound interest?</h3>
          <p>Compound interest is interest calculated on the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. It's often called "interest on interest" and is the key to building wealth over time.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How does compound interest work?</h3>
          <p>With compound interest, you earn returns not only on your original investment but also on the interest that has already been added to your account. This creates exponential growth over time.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between simple and compound interest?</h3>
          <p>Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any previously earned interest. Compound interest grows much faster over long periods.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How often should interest compound?</h3>
          <p>Interest can compound daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually. More frequent compounding generally results in higher returns, though the difference becomes smaller as the frequency increases.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Why is time so important in compound interest?</h3>
          <p>Time is the most powerful factor in compound interest because it allows your returns to generate their own returns. Starting early, even with small amounts, often beats starting later with larger amounts.</p>
        </div>
