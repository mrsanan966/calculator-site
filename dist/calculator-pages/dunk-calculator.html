        <h2>How to Use Our Dunk Calculator</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Enter Your Height:</strong> Input your standing height and reach</li>
          <li><strong>Set Rim Height:</strong> Choose standard 10-foot rim or custom height</li>
          <li><strong>Add Jump Data:</strong> Include your vertical jump measurement</li>
          <li><strong>View Results:</strong> See your dunk potential and requirements</li>

      <section>
        <h2>Dunk Calculation Formula</h2>
        <p>Your dunk potential is calculated using:</p>
        <p><strong>Dunk Height = Standing Reach + Vertical Jump</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Required Jump = Rim Height - Standing Reach</strong></p>
        <p>Where: Standing Reach = Height + Arm Length</p>
        <p>Our calculator accounts for different rim heights and body proportions.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>How high do I need to jump to dunk?</h3>
          <p>Your required jump height depends on your standing reach and the rim height. For a 10-foot rim, you typically need to jump 24-30 inches, depending on your height and arm length.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between standing and running vertical jump?</h3>
          <p>Standing vertical jump is measured from a stationary position, while running vertical jump includes a running start. Running jumps are typically 4-8 inches higher due to momentum and approach speed.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How can I improve my vertical jump for dunking?</h3>
          <p>Focus on plyometric exercises, strength training, and proper jumping technique. Include squats, lunges, box jumps, and calf raises in your training routine. Practice jumping with proper form and landing mechanics.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What factors affect dunking ability?</h3>
          <p>Key factors include height, arm length, leg strength, jumping technique, and body composition. Shorter players need higher vertical jumps, while taller players can dunk with lower jumps.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How do I measure my vertical jump accurately?</h3>
          <p>Use a wall, chalk, and measuring tape. Stand next to a wall, reach up as high as possible, mark the spot, then jump and mark your highest reach. The difference is your vertical jump height.</p>
