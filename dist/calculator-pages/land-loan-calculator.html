        <h2>Land Loan Payment Formula</h2>
        <p>Your land loan payment is calculated using:</p>
        <p><strong>M = P × (r × (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)</strong></p>
        <p>Where: P = Loan amount, r = Monthly interest rate, n = Number of payments</p>
        <p>Land loans typically have higher rates and shorter terms than traditional mortgages.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>What is a land loan?</h3>
          <p>A land loan is financing specifically for purchasing vacant land, raw land, or undeveloped property. These loans typically have higher interest rates and shorter terms than traditional mortgages because land is considered riskier collateral.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How much down payment is required for land loans?</h3>
          <p>Land loans typically require 20-50% down payment, depending on the land type, location, and your creditworthiness. Raw land usually requires the highest down payment, while improved land may require less.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What factors affect land loan interest rates?</h3>
          <p>Land loan rates are influenced by the land type (raw vs. improved), location, your credit score, down payment amount, loan term, and the lender's risk assessment. Rates are typically higher than traditional mortgage rates.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between raw land and improved land loans?</h3>
          <p>Raw land has no utilities or improvements and requires higher down payments and rates. Improved land has utilities and may qualify for better terms. Development land falls somewhere in between.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Can I get a land loan for investment purposes?</h3>
          <p>Yes, but investment land loans typically have stricter requirements, higher rates, and larger down payments. Lenders may require a business plan or development timeline for investment land purchases.</p>
        </div>
