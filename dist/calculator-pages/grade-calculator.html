        <h2>Grade Calculation Formula</h2>
        <p>Your final grade is calculated using:</p>
        <p><strong>Final Grade = Σ (Assignment Grade × Weight) ÷ Total Weight</strong></p>
        <p>Where: Assignment Grade = Points Earned ÷ Points Possible</p>
        <p>Weighted categories ensure different assignment types contribute appropriately to your final grade.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>How do I calculate my current grade?</h3>
          <p>Add up all your points earned, divide by total points possible, then multiply by 100. For weighted grades, multiply each category grade by its weight percentage, then sum the results.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between weighted and unweighted grades?</h3>
          <p>Unweighted grades treat all assignments equally. Weighted grades give different importance to different assignment types (e.g., tests worth 40%, homework worth 20%, final exam worth 40%).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How can I improve my grade if it's low?</h3>
          <p>Focus on high-weight assignments first, attend office hours, form study groups, and prioritize assignments with the most impact on your final grade. Use our calculator to identify which assignments matter most.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What grade do I need on the final to pass?</h3>
          <p>Use our calculator to determine the minimum grade needed on remaining assignments. Input your current grade and see what you need to achieve your target final grade.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How do I handle extra credit assignments?</h3>
          <p>Extra credit can boost your grade, but it's typically added to your total points rather than replacing poor grades. Check with your instructor about how extra credit is calculated in your course.</p>
