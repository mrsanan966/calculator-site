        <h2>Snow Day Calculation Factors</h2>
        <p>Snow day probability is calculated based on:</p>
        <p><strong>Temperature: Below 32째F (0째C) for snow formation</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Precipitation: Snow accumulation rates and intensity</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Wind Conditions: Wind chill and visibility factors</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Historical Data: Past snow day patterns for your area</strong></p>
        <p>Our calculator considers local school district policies and weather thresholds.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>What factors determine if schools close for snow?</h3>
          <p>Schools consider temperature, snow accumulation, road conditions, visibility, and wind chill. Most districts close when temperatures drop below 0째F or when snow accumulation exceeds 2-3 inches.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How accurate are snow day predictions?</h3>
          <p>Weather predictions are generally accurate 3-5 days in advance, but snow day decisions depend on local conditions and school district policies. Our calculator provides probability estimates based on historical data.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between a snow day and a cold day?</h3>
          <p>Snow days are called for snow accumulation and poor road conditions. Cold days are called for extreme temperatures (typically below -10째F) that make it unsafe for students to wait for buses or walk to school.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How do I prepare for a potential snow day?</h3>
          <p>Check weather forecasts regularly, have backup childcare plans, stock up on essentials, and stay informed about school district announcements. Our calculator helps you plan ahead for winter weather.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Can I use this calculator for work closures too?</h3>
