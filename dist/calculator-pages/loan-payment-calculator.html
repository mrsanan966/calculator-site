          <li><strong>Set Payment Options:</strong> Choose regular payments or extra payments</li>
          <li><strong>Add Early Payoff:</strong> Include any additional principal payments</li>
          <li><strong>View Amortization:</strong> See detailed payment schedule and interest breakdown</li>

      <section>
        <h2>Advanced Loan Payment Formula</h2>
        <p>Your monthly loan payment is calculated using:</p>
        <p><strong>M = P × (r × (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)</strong></p>
        <p>Where: P = Principal, r = Monthly interest rate, n = Number of payments</p>
        <p>Extra payments reduce the principal faster, saving interest over time.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>What is an amortization schedule?</h3>
          <p>An amortization schedule shows how each payment is split between principal and interest over the life of the loan. Initially, more goes to interest; later, more goes to principal.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How do extra payments affect my loan?</h3>
          <p>Extra payments go directly to principal, reducing your balance faster and saving significant interest. Even small extra payments can shorten your loan term and save thousands in interest.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Should I make extra payments or invest the money?</h3>
          <p>Compare your loan interest rate to potential investment returns. If your loan rate is higher than expected investment returns, extra payments make sense. Consider your risk tolerance and financial goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between bi-weekly and monthly payments?</h3>
          <p>Bi-weekly payments (26 per year) equal 13 monthly payments, paying off your loan faster and saving interest. This strategy can reduce a 30-year mortgage to about 25 years.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How can I calculate the best payment strategy?</h3>
          <p>Use our calculator to compare different scenarios: regular payments vs. extra payments vs. bi-weekly payments. Consider your budget, financial goals, and other investment opportunities.</p>
