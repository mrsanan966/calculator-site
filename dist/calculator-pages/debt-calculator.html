        <h2>Debt Payoff Strategies</h2>
        <p><strong>Debt Snowball:</strong> Pay minimums on all debts, then put extra money toward the smallest balance first. This provides psychological wins and builds momentum.</p>
        <p><strong>Debt Avalanche:</strong> Pay minimums on all debts, then put extra money toward the highest interest rate first. This saves the most money on interest.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>Which debt payoff strategy is better?</h3>
          <p>The debt avalanche (highest interest first) saves more money, while the debt snowball (smallest balance first) provides faster psychological wins. Choose based on your personality and motivation style.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How much extra should I pay toward debt?</h3>
          <p>Pay as much extra as you can afford after covering minimum payments and essential expenses. Even small extra payments can significantly reduce your payoff time and total interest paid.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Should I consolidate my debts?</h3>
          <p>Debt consolidation can simplify payments and potentially lower interest rates, but it's not always the best option. Consider your credit score, available rates, and whether you'll be disciplined about not accumulating new debt.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How can I stay motivated while paying off debt?</h3>
          <p>Track your progress, celebrate small wins, visualize your debt-free future, and consider the debt snowball method for quick victories. Join online communities for support and accountability.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What if I can't make extra payments?</h3>
          <p>Focus on making minimum payments on time to avoid fees and penalties. Look for ways to increase income or reduce expenses. Even small changes can free up money for debt payments.</p>
