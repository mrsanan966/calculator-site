        <h2>Tax Calculation Formula</h2>
        <p>Your tax liability is calculated using progressive tax brackets:</p>
        <p><strong>Taxable Income = Gross Income - Deductions</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Tax Liability = (Taxable Income Ã— Tax Rate) - Credits</strong></p>
        <p>Federal taxes use progressive rates from 10% to 37% based on income brackets.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>How is my tax liability calculated?</h3>
          <p>Your tax liability is based on your taxable income (gross income minus deductions) and your filing status. The IRS uses progressive tax brackets, so different portions of your income are taxed at different rates.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between standard and itemized deductions?</h3>
          <p>The standard deduction is a fixed amount you can deduct without itemizing. Itemized deductions require listing specific expenses like mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and medical expenses. Choose whichever gives you the larger deduction.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How can I reduce my tax liability?</h3>
          <p>You can reduce taxes through deductions (retirement contributions, business expenses), credits (child tax credit, education credits), and tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA, HSA). Consider consulting a tax professional for personalized advice.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>When should I adjust my tax withholding?</h3>
          <p>Adjust withholding when you have major life changes like marriage, divorce, having children, buying a home, or changing jobs. The goal is to have your withholding match your actual tax liability to avoid large refunds or penalties.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What are tax credits vs. deductions?</h3>
          <p>Deductions reduce your taxable income, while credits directly reduce your tax liability dollar-for-dollar. Credits are generally more valuable than deductions of the same amount.</p>
        </div>
