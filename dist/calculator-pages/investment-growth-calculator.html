        <h2>Investment Growth Formula</h2>
        <p>Your investment growth is calculated using compound interest:</p>
        <p><strong>Future Value = PV × (1 + r)^n + PMT × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r]</strong></p>
        <p>Where: PV = Present value, r = Monthly return rate, n = Number of months, PMT = Monthly contribution</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>What's a realistic expected return for investments?</h3>
          <p>Historical stock market returns average 7-10% annually, but this varies by investment type and time period. Conservative investments might return 3-5%, while aggressive growth investments might target 10-12% or higher.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How does compound interest work in investments?</h3>
          <p>Compound interest means you earn returns not only on your initial investment but also on previously earned returns. This creates exponential growth over time, making it one of the most powerful wealth-building tools.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Should I invest monthly or in lump sums?</h3>
          <p>Dollar-cost averaging (monthly investments) can reduce risk and smooth out market volatility. Lump sum investing might provide higher returns if markets rise, but monthly investing is often more practical and less risky.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How much should I invest monthly?</h3>
          <p>The amount depends on your financial goals, income, and expenses. A common rule is to invest 10-20% of your income, but start with what you can afford and increase over time. Even small amounts can grow significantly with compound interest.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between investing and saving?</h3>
          <p>Saving typically involves low-risk accounts like savings accounts or CDs, while investing involves higher-risk assets like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds that have the potential for higher returns but also higher risk.</p>
