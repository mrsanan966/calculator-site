        <h2>Car Payment Formula</h2>
        <p>Your monthly car payment is calculated using:</p>
        <p><strong>M = P × (r × (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)</strong></p>
        <p>Where: P = Loan amount, r = Monthly interest rate, n = Number of payments</p>
        <p>This formula accounts for the principal and interest portions of your payment.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>How much should I put down on a car?</h3>
          <p>A down payment of 20% is recommended to avoid negative equity, but many loans allow as little as 0-10%. A larger down payment reduces your loan amount, monthly payments, and total interest paid.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's a good interest rate for a car loan?</h3>
          <p>Good rates vary by credit score: excellent credit (720+) can get 3-5%, good credit (680-719) gets 5-8%, and fair credit (620-679) gets 8-15%. Shop around for the best rates from multiple lenders.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How long should my car loan term be?</h3>
          <p>Shorter terms (36-48 months) mean higher payments but less total interest. Longer terms (60-84 months) mean lower payments but more total interest. Consider your budget and financial goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Should I finance through the dealer or my bank?</h3>
          <p>Compare rates from both sources. Dealers may offer incentives but could have higher rates. Your bank or credit union might offer better terms. Get pre-approved to negotiate from a position of strength.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's included in my monthly car payment?</h3>
          <p>Your payment typically includes principal and interest. It may also include sales tax, registration fees, and other charges depending on your state and how you structure the loan.</p>
        </div>
