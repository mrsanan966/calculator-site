        <h2>Savings Growth Formula</h2>
        <p>Your savings growth is calculated using compound interest:</p>
        <p><strong>Future Value = PV × (1 + r)^n + PMT × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r]</strong></p>
        <p>Where: PV = Present savings, r = Monthly interest rate, n = Number of months, PMT = Monthly contribution</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>How much should I save each month?</h3>
          <p>The amount depends on your financial goals, income, and expenses. A common rule is to save 20% of your income, but start with what you can afford and increase over time. Even small amounts can grow significantly with compound interest.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the best interest rate for savings?</h3>
          <p>High-yield savings accounts typically offer 3-5% APY, while CDs might offer slightly higher rates. Online banks often provide better rates than traditional banks. Compare rates regularly to maximize your returns.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How does compound interest work in savings?</h3>
          <p>Compound interest means you earn interest not only on your principal but also on previously earned interest. This creates exponential growth over time, making it one of the most powerful wealth-building tools.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Should I use a savings account or invest my money?</h3>
          <p>Use savings accounts for emergency funds and short-term goals (1-3 years). For long-term goals (5+ years), consider investing in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds for potentially higher returns, though with more risk.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How can I maximize my savings growth?</h3>
          <p>Maximize growth by saving consistently, finding the highest interest rates, avoiding fees, and reinvesting your interest. Consider automatic transfers to make saving effortless and consistent.</p>
