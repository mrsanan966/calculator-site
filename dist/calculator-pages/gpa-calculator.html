        <h2>GPA Calculation Formula</h2>
        <p>Your GPA is calculated using:</p>
        <p><strong>GPA = Σ (Grade Points × Credit Hours) ÷ Total Credit Hours</strong></p>
        <p>Where Grade Points = A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0 (on 4.0 scale)</p>
        <p>Weighted GPAs may give extra points for honors, AP, or IB courses.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>What is GPA and why is it important?</h3>
          <p>GPA (Grade Point Average) is a numerical representation of your academic performance. It's important for college admissions, scholarships, graduate school applications, and job opportunities.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between weighted and unweighted GPA?</h3>
          <p>Unweighted GPA uses a standard 4.0 scale where A=4, B=3, etc. Weighted GPA gives extra points for advanced courses (honors, AP, IB), often using a 5.0 or higher scale.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How do I calculate my cumulative GPA?</h3>
          <p>Add all your grade points (grade × credit hours) from all semesters, then divide by total credit hours attempted. This gives you your overall academic performance.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's considered a good GPA?</h3>
          <p>A good GPA varies by context: 3.0+ is generally acceptable, 3.5+ is good, 3.7+ is very good, and 3.9+ is excellent. Consider your school's grading scale and academic rigor.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Can I improve my GPA if it's low?</h3>
          <p>Yes, you can improve your GPA by earning higher grades in future courses. The more credit hours you complete, the less impact individual grades have on your cumulative GPA.</p>
