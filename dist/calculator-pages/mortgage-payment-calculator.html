        <h2>Mortgage Payment Formula</h2>
        <p>Your monthly mortgage payment is calculated using:</p>
        <p><strong>M = P × (r × (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)</strong></p>
        <p>Where: P = Principal loan amount, r = Monthly interest rate, n = Number of payments</p>
        <p>This formula accounts for both principal and interest portions of your payment.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>What's included in my monthly mortgage payment?</h3>
          <p>Your monthly payment typically includes principal, interest, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and possibly PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) if your down payment is less than 20%.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How much should I put down on a house?</h3>
          <p>A down payment of 20% is recommended to avoid PMI, but many loans allow as little as 3-5%. Larger down payments reduce your loan amount, monthly payments, and total interest paid.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Should I choose a 15-year or 30-year mortgage?</h3>
          <p>A 15-year mortgage has higher monthly payments but less total interest paid. A 30-year mortgage has lower monthly payments but costs more in total interest. Consider your budget and long-term financial goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What factors affect my mortgage interest rate?</h3>
          <p>Your interest rate is influenced by your credit score, loan term, down payment amount, loan type (fixed vs. adjustable), and current market rates. Better credit scores and larger down payments typically result in lower rates.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Can I pay off my mortgage early?</h3>
          <p>Yes, making extra payments towards your principal can significantly reduce the loan term and total interest paid. Many calculators allow you to simulate this and see the potential savings.</p>
