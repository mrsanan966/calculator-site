      <section>
        <h2>Refinance Savings Formula</h2>
        <p>Your refinance savings are calculated by comparing:</p>
        <p><strong>Monthly Savings = Current Payment - New Payment</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Break-Even Point = Refinancing Costs รท Monthly Savings</strong></p>
        <p>This shows how long it takes to recover your refinancing costs through monthly savings.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>When should I refinance my mortgage?</h3>
          <p>Consider refinancing when interest rates have dropped significantly (at least 0.5-1%), when you can get a better rate due to improved credit, or when you want to change your loan term. The key is ensuring the savings justify the costs.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How much can I save by refinancing?</h3>
          <p>Your savings depend on the interest rate difference, loan amount, and remaining term. Even a 0.5% rate reduction can save thousands over the life of the loan. Use our calculator to see your specific potential savings.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What costs are involved in refinancing?</h3>
          <p>Refinancing costs typically include application fees, appraisal fees, title insurance, closing costs, and prepaid items. These usually range from 2-5% of your loan amount, but some lenders offer no-cost refinancing options.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How long does it take to break even on refinancing?</h3>
          <p>The break-even point is when your monthly savings equal your refinancing costs. If you plan to stay in your home longer than the break-even period, refinancing makes financial sense.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Should I refinance to a shorter or longer term?</h3>
          <p>A shorter term means higher payments but less total interest. A longer term means lower payments but more total interest. Choose based on your budget and financial goals.</p>
        </div>
