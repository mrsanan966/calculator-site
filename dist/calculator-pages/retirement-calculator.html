        <h2>Retirement Planning Formula</h2>
        <p>Your retirement savings are calculated using compound interest:</p>
        <p><strong>Future Value = PV × (1 + r)^n + PMT × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r]</strong></p>
        <p>Where: PV = Present value of savings, r = Monthly return rate, n = Number of months until retirement, PMT = Monthly contribution</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>How much should I save for retirement?</h3>
          <p>A common rule is to save 10-15% of your income for retirement, but the exact amount depends on your age, income, and retirement goals. Use the 4% rule: aim to save 25 times your annual expenses.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between 401(k) and IRA accounts?</h3>
          <p>A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan with higher contribution limits, while an IRA is an individual retirement account you open yourself. Both offer tax advantages, but 401(k)s often include employer matching contributions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>When should I start saving for retirement?</h3>
          <p>The earlier you start, the better due to compound interest. Even starting in your 20s with small amounts can result in significant retirement savings. However, it's never too late to start saving for retirement.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How does inflation affect retirement planning?</h3>
          <p>Inflation reduces the purchasing power of your money over time. When planning for retirement, consider that expenses will likely be higher in the future, so you may need more savings than current dollar amounts suggest.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the 4% retirement withdrawal rule?</h3>
          <p>The 4% rule suggests you can withdraw 4% of your retirement savings annually without running out of money. This means if you have $1 million saved, you could withdraw $40,000 per year in retirement.</p>
