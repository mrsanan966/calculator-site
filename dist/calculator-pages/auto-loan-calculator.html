        <h2>Auto Loan Payment Formula</h2>
        <p>Your monthly auto loan payment is calculated using the formula:</p>
        <p><strong>M = P × (r × (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)</strong></p>
        <p>Where: P = Loan Amount, r = Monthly Interest Rate, n = Number of Payments</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>How is my auto loan payment calculated?</h3>
          <p>Your auto loan payment is determined by the principal loan amount (car price minus down payment), the interest rate, and the loan term. The calculator uses an amortization formula to spread payments over the loan period.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What factors influence my auto loan interest rate?</h3>
          <p>Your credit score is the biggest factor. Other influences include the loan term, the amount of your down payment, the type of vehicle, and current market interest rates. A higher credit score generally leads to a lower interest rate.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Is a longer auto loan term always better?</h3>
          <p>A longer loan term typically results in lower monthly payments, making the car more 'affordable' on a monthly basis. However, you'll pay more in total interest over the life of the loan. Shorter terms mean higher payments but less overall cost.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How much should I put down on a car?</h3>
          <p>While there's no strict rule, a larger down payment reduces your loan amount, which means lower monthly payments and less interest paid. Aim for at least 10-20% if possible to reduce your financial burden.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What is included in my monthly car payment?</h3>
          <p>Your monthly car payment primarily covers the principal (the amount borrowed) and interest. It may also include sales tax, registration fees, and other charges depending on your state and dealership.</p>
        </div>
