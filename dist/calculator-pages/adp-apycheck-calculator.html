        <h2>APY Calculation Formula</h2>
        <p>Annual Percentage Yield is calculated using:</p>
        <p><strong>APY = (1 + r/n)^n - 1</strong></p>
        <p>Where: r = Annual interest rate, n = Number of compounding periods per year</p>
        <p>APY reflects the true annual rate of return, accounting for compounding effects.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>What is APY and how does it differ from APR?</h3>
          <p>APY (Annual Percentage Yield) is the true annual rate of return, including compounding effects. APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is the simple interest rate. APY is always higher than APR when compounding occurs.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How does compounding frequency affect APY?</h3>
          <p>More frequent compounding increases APY. Daily compounding typically yields higher returns than monthly or quarterly compounding. Our calculator shows the impact of different compounding frequencies on your earnings.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between APY and interest rate?</h3>
          <p>Interest rate is the stated rate, while APY is the effective rate after compounding. APY gives you the true annual return on your investment, making it easier to compare different savings options.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How do I choose the best APY for my savings?</h3>
          <p>Compare APY rates from multiple institutions, consider minimum balance requirements, fees, and account features. Higher APY rates often come with conditions like minimum balances or limited transactions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Can APY change over time?</h3>
          <p>Yes, APY can change based on market conditions and bank policies. Variable-rate accounts may see APY adjustments, while fixed-rate accounts maintain the same APY for the term period.</p>
        </div>
