        <h2>Credit Card Interest Formula</h2>
        <p>Credit card interest is calculated daily using:</p>
        <p><strong>Daily Interest = (Balance × APR) ÷ 365</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Monthly Interest = Daily Interest × Days in Month</strong></p>
        <p>This means interest compounds daily, making credit card debt expensive over time.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>How is credit card interest calculated?</h3>
          <p>Credit card interest is calculated daily using your average daily balance and your APR. The interest is then added to your balance, creating compound interest that can quickly increase your debt.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the difference between APR and interest rate?</h3>
          <p>APR (Annual Percentage Rate) includes the interest rate plus any fees, giving you the true cost of borrowing. The interest rate is just the cost of borrowing money, while APR includes all costs.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How can I reduce my credit card interest?</h3>
          <p>You can reduce interest by paying more than the minimum payment, transferring to a lower-rate card, negotiating with your current issuer, or using the debt avalanche method to pay off high-rate cards first.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Should I pay the minimum payment or more?</h3>
          <p>Always pay more than the minimum if possible. Minimum payments are designed to keep you in debt longer and cost you more in interest. Even small extra payments can significantly reduce your payoff time.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What's the best strategy for paying off credit cards?</h3>
          <p>The debt avalanche method (highest interest first) saves the most money, while the debt snowball method (smallest balance first) provides faster psychological wins. Choose based on your motivation style.</p>
