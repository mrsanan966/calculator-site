### **Phase 1: Content Optimization (Week 1-2)**

#### **1.1 Create Unique Content for Each Calculator**

**Mortgage Calculator:**
```html
<!-- Current (Weak) -->
<title>Mortgage Calculator | FinCalc</title>
<meta name="description" content="Calculate your mortgage payments with our free mortgage calculator." />

<!-- Optimized (Strong) -->
<title>Free Mortgage Calculator 2024 - Calculate Monthly Payments & Amortization</title>
<meta name="description" content="Calculate your monthly mortgage payments with our free mortgage calculator. Get accurate estimates for principal, interest, PMI, taxes, and insurance. View amortization schedules and compare loan options." />
```

**Auto Loan Calculator:**

<meta name="description" content="Calculate your monthly auto loan payments with our free auto loan calculator. Get accurate estimates for car payments, total interest, and loan costs. Compare different terms and rates." />
```

#### **1.2 Add Comprehensive FAQ Sections**

Each calculator needs 5-10 unique FAQs:

- "What factors affect my mortgage interest rate?"
- "Should I choose a 15-year or 30-year mortgage?"
- "How much should I put down on a house?"
- "What's included in my monthly mortgage payment?"

### **Phase 2: Technical SEO Implementation (Week 3-4)**

```

**Option B: Static Site Generation**
```javascript
// Generate static HTML for each calculator
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [
      { params: { calculator: 'mortgage' } },
      { params: { calculator: 'auto-loan' } },
      { params: { calculator: 'student-loan' } },
      // ... all calculators
    ],
    fallback: false,

  const seoData = generateCalculatorSEO(params.calculator);
  return {
    props: { seoData },
  }
}
```

#### **2.2 Fix Meta Tag Implementation**

**Current Issue:**

export default function MortgageCalculatorPage({ seoData }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>{seoData.title}</title>
        <meta name="description" content={seoData.description} />
        <meta name="keywords" content={seoData.keywords} />
        <link rel="canonical" href={seoData.canonical} />
